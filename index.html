                <p>
                    The origins of the samurai , Japan's warrior caste, go back to the ninth century, when the feudal lords began to maintain regular forces. Gradually, they evolved into an elite group of hereditary warriors, their lives governed by an unwritten code of behaviour which came to be known as bushido , the way of the warrior . Though practice was often far from the ideal, bushido encouraged rigorous self-discipline, the observance of strict laws of etiquette and, most importantly, unquestioning loyalty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to this code, the samurai , his wife and children were expected to die willingly to protect the life and honour of their feudal lord. If they failed in this duty, or were about to be taken prisoner on a battlefield, then suicide was the only fitting response. The traditional, and excruciatingly painful, method of ritual suicide was disembowelment with a sword or dagger ( seppuku ), though in later years an accomplice would stand by to cut off the victim's head. However, there were many variations on the theme; one particularly gruesome legend tells of a warrior who had himself buried alive, in full armour, astride his poor horse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The samurai creed reached full bloom in the early Tokugawa era, when class distinctions were officially delineated. The samurai were deemed "the masters of the four classes" - above farmers, artisans and merchants - and they alone were permitted to carry swords. They even had the right to kill any member of the lower orders for disrespectful behaviour - real or imagined. This privilege was graphically known as kirisute-gomen , literally "cut, throw away, pardon".
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the more peaceful seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, many samurai found themselves out of work as their lords were dispossessed and fiefdoms redistributed. Many became ronin , or masterless samurai , whose lives were romanticized in such films as The Seven Samurai . Among the most celebrated were the 47 ronin and an individual called Musashi, who reputedly prevailed in 66 sword fights, several against heavy odds, and then went to live in a cave since there was no one else worthy of the challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As their fighting skills were no longer required, the samurai grew increasingly impoverished and demoralized. Some found alternative ways to earn a living, while others were encouraged to study and later proved invaluable administrators in the post-1868 Meiji administration. At the same time the government formally abolished the samurai system, and only allowed members of the new imperial army to wear swords. All this was too much for some of the old guard, the most famous of which was Saigo Takamori. A larger-than-life hero, Saigo led a rebellion against the Meiji government in 1877 and died on the battlefield in true samurai spirit, fighting to the end against desperate odds.

                        Miyamoto Musashi, Japan's most famous Samurai, began his musha-shugyo (warrior pilgrimage). Musashi fought and won more than 60 sword fights before the age of 30.

At the age of 60, Musashi wrote Gorin No Sho ("The Book of Five Spheres"), the most famous writing about the Japanese Sword Arts. He also wrote "The 35 Articles on the Art of Swordsmanship."
